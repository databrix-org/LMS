Help me full this react component. I am using jupyterlab extension template to create this react component.
https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/classes/filebrowser.FileBrowser-1.html Search this URL and learn how to deal with files in jupyterlab extension.
This is the structure of this React Component:

-Component EditAssignmentPage
    - Component 'ListNotebook'
        - Component 'Delete File Button'
    - Component 'ListMaterials'
        - Component 'Delete File Button'
    - Component 'Upload File Button'

The description for each Component:

Component EditAssignmentPage (input: Directory path):

Component 'ListNotebook'(input: Directory path)

    i. It shows the words 'Your Assignment Notebook'.
    ii. Search the given directory. Find and List all files end with .ipynb in this directory.
    iii. Add Component 'Delete File Button' to right side of each listed .ipynb files

Component 'ListMaterials'(input: Directory path):

    i. then show words: 'Your other materials'.
    ii. Search the given directory. Find and List all other files except .ipynb files in this directory
    iii. Add Component 'Delete File Button' to right side of each listed file

Component 'Delete File Button':
    i delete the file on the left side
Component 'Upload File Button' (input: Directory path):
    i. Upload selected file to this directory

Firstly, understand the description and the structure of the Components. Then figure out how to write the Code.
